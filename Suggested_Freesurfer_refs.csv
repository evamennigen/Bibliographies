In order to study such cortical properties in humans, it is necessary to obtain an accurate and explicit representation of the cortical surface in individual subjects. Here we describe a set of automated procedures for obtaining accurate reconstructions of the cortical surface, which have been applied to data from more than 100 subjects, requiring little or no manual intervention. Automated routines for unfolding and flattening the cortical surface are described in a companion paper. These procedures allow for the routine use of cortical surface-based analysis and visualization methods in functional brain imaging.","1999-02","2019-01-10 01:29:16","2019-01-10 01:29:18","","179-194","","2","9","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 9931268","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9931268","","Brain Mapping; Cerebral Cortex; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Reference Values; Software","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ""inverse problem"" of estimating the distribution of dipole strengths over the cortical surface is highly underdetermined, even given closely spaced EEG and MEG recordings. We have obtained much better solutions to this problem by explicitly incorporating both local cortical orientation as well as spatial covariance of sources and sensors into our formulation. An explicit polygonal model of the cortical manifold is first constructed as follows: (1) slice data in three orthogonal planes of section (needle-shaped voxels) are combined with a linear deblurring technique to make a single high-resolution 3-D image (cubic voxels), (2) the image is recursively flood-filled to determine the topology of the gray-white matter border, and (3) the resulting continuous surface is refined by relaxing it against the original 3-D gray-scale image using a deformable template method, which is also used to computationally flatten the cortex for easier viewing. The explicit solution to an error minimization formulation of an optimal inverse linear operator (for a particular cortical manifold, sensor placement, noise and prior source covariance) gives rise to a compact expression that is practically computable for hundreds of sensors and thousands of sources. The inverse solution can then be weighted for a particular (averaged) event using the sensor covariance for that event. Model studies suggest that we may be able to localize multiple cortical sources with spatial resolution as good as PET with this technique, while retaining a much finer grained picture of activity over time.","1993","2019-01-10 01:29:49","2019-01-10 01:29:49","","162-176","","2","5","","J Cogn Neurosci","Improved Localizadon of Cortical Activity by Combining EEG and MEG with MRI Cortical Surface Reconstruction","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 23972151","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23972151","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a dataset of 40 MRI scans we manually identified 34 cortical ROIs in each of the individual hemispheres. This information was then encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to automatically label ROIs. To examine the validity, as well as the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated system, we used both intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and a new method known as mean distance maps, to assess the degree of mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of ROIs. When compared with the manual ROIs, the automated ROIs were highly accurate, with an average ICC of 0.835 across all of the ROIs, and a mean distance error of less than 1 mm. Intra- and inter-rater comparisons yielded little to no difference between the sets of ROIs. These findings suggest that the automated method we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex into standard gyral-based neuroanatomical regions is both anatomically valid and reliable. This method may be useful for both morphometric and functional studies of the cerebral cortex as well as for clinical investigations aimed at tracking the evolution of disease-induced changes over time, including clinical trials in which MRI-based measures are used to examine response to treatment.","2006-07-01","2019-01-10 01:30:05","2019-01-10 01:30:05","","968-980","","3","31","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 16530430","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16530430","","Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Algorithms; Alzheimer Disease; Atrophy; Brain Mapping; Cerebral Cortex; Corpus Callosum; Dominance, Cerebral; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Observer Variation; Reproducibility of Results; Software; Statistics as Topic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Manual methods for estimating cortical thickness from neuroimaging data are labor intensive, requiring several days of effort by a trained anatomist. Furthermore, the highly folded nature of the cortex is problematic for manual techniques, frequently resulting in measurement errors in regions in which the cortical surface is not perpendicular to any of the cardinal axes. As a consequence, it has been impractical to obtain accurate thickness estimates for the entire cortex in individual subjects, or group statistics for patient or control populations. Here, we present an automated method for accurately measuring the thickness of the cerebral cortex across the entire brain and for generating cross-subject statistics in a coordinate system based on cortical anatomy. The intersubject standard deviation of the thickness measures is shown to be less than 0.5 mm, implying the ability to detect focal atrophy in small populations or even individual subjects. The reliability and accuracy of this new method are assessed by within-subject test-retest studies, as well as by comparison of cross-subject regional thickness measures with published values.","2000-09-26","2019-01-10 01:30:23","2019-01-10 01:30:23","","11050-11055","","20","97","","Proc.

The construction of such models is difficult using current neuroimaging technology due to the high degree of cortical folding. Even single voxel misclassifications can result in erroneous connections being created between adjacent banks of a sulcus, resulting in a topologically inaccurate model. These topological defects cause the cortical model to no longer be homeomorphic to a sheet, preventing the accurate inflation, flattening, or spherical morphing of the reconstructed cortex. Surface deformation techniques can guarantee the topological correctness of a model, but are time-consuming and may result in geometrically inaccurate models. In order to address this need we have developed a technique for taking a model of the cortex, detecting and fixing the topological defects while leaving that majority of the model intact, resulting in a surface that is both geometrically accurate and topologically correct.","2001-01","2019-01-10 01:30:50","2019-01-10 01:30:50","","70-80","","1","20","","IEEE Trans Med Imaging","Automated manifold surgery","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 11293693","","/Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/PJVNQWD7/Fischl et al. - 2001 - Automated manifold surgery constructing geometric.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11293693","","Cerebral Cortex; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This results in substantial invariance to acquisition parameters, as the effect of these parameters on the contrast properties of various brain structures is explicitly modeled in the segmentation. In addition, the integration of image acquisition with tissue classification allows the derivation of sequences that are optimal for segmentation purposes. Another benefit of these procedures is the generation of probabilistic models of the intrinsic tissue parameters that cause MR contrast (e.g., T1, proton density, T2*), allowing access to these physiologically relevant parameters that may change with disease or demographic, resulting in nonmorphometric alterations in MR images that are otherwise difficult to detect. Finally, we also present a high band width multiecho FLASH pulse sequence that results in high signal-to-noise ratio with minimal image distortion due to B0 effects. This sequence has the added benefit of allowing the explicit estimation of T2* and of reducing test-retest intensity variability.","2004","2019-01-10 01:31:53","2019-01-10 01:31:53","","S69-84","","","23 Suppl 1","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 15501102","","/Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/AMCMXA9E/Fischl et al. - 2004 - Sequence-independent segmentation of magnetic reso.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15501102","","Algorithms; Brain; Cerebral Cortex; Echo-Planar Imaging; Functional Laterality; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Models, Statistical; Nonlinear Dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cortical maps are typically arranged with a topography oriented parallel to the cortical surface. Despite this unambiguous sheetlike geometry, the most commonly used coordinate systems for localizing cortical features are based on 3-D stereotaxic coordinates rather than on position relative to the 2-D cortical sheet. In order to address the need for a more natural surface-based coordinate system for the cortex, we have developed a means for generating an average folding pattern across a large number of individual subjects as a function on the unit sphere and of nonrigidly aligning each individual with the average. This establishes a spherical surface-based coordinate system that is adapted to the folding pattern of each individual subject, allowing for much higher localization accuracy of structural and functional features of the human brain.","1999","2019-01-10 01:32:24","2019-01-10 01:32:24","","272-284","","4","8","","Hum Brain Mapp","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 10619420","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10619420","","Brain Mapping; Cerebral Cortex; Genetic Variation; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Models, Anatomic; Models, Neurological","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated how the reliability of cortical thickness measurements is affected by MRI instrument-related factors, including scanner field strength, manufacturer, upgrade and pulse sequence. Several data processing factors were also studied. Two test-retest data sets were analyzed: 1) 15 healthy older subjects scanned four times at 2-week intervals on three scanners; 2) 5 subjects scanned before and after a major scanner upgrade. Within-scanner variability of global cortical thickness measurements was <0.03 mm, and the point-wise standard deviation of measurement error was approximately 0.12 mm. Variability was 0.15 mm and 0.17 mm in average, respectively, for cross-scanner (Siemens/GE) and cross-field strength (1.5 T/3 T) comparisons. Scanner upgrade did not increase variability nor introduce bias. Measurements across field strength, however, were slightly biased (thicker at 3 T). The number of (single vs. multiple averaged) acquisitions had a negligible effect on reliability, but the use of a different pulse sequence had a larger impact, as did different parameters employed in data processing. Sample size estimates indicate that regional cortical thickness difference of 0.2 mm between two different groups could be identified with as few as 7 subjects per group, and a difference of 0.1 mm could be detected with 26 subjects per group. These results demonstrate that MRI-derived cortical thickness measures are highly reliable when MRI instrument and data processing factors are controlled but that it is important to consider these factors in the design of multi-site or longitudinal studies, such as clinical drug trials.","2006-08-01","2019-01-10 01:32:53","2019-01-10 01:32:53","","180-194","","1","32","","Neuroimage","Reliability of MRI-derived measurements of human cerebral cortical thickness","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 16651008","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16651008","","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brain Mapping; Cerebral Cortex; Functional Laterality; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Reference Values; Reproducibility of Results","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The question of whether cortical thickness is reduced in schizophrenia has not been addressed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques. Our objectives were to test the hypothesis that cortical thinning in patients with schizophrenia (relative to control subjects) is greater in temporal and prefrontal regions of interest (ROIs) than in control ROIs (superior parietal, calcarine, postcentral, central, and precentral cortices), and to obtain an unbiased estimate of the distribution of cortical thinning in patients (relative to controls) by constructing mean and statistical cortical thickness difference maps. METHODS: Participants included 33 right-handed outpatients receiving medication and meeting DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia and 32 healthy volunteers, matched on age and parental socioeconomic status. After high-resolution MRI scans, models of the gray-white and pial surfaces were generated for each individual's cortex, and the distance between these 2 surfaces was used to compute cortical thickness. A surface-based averaging technique that aligned the main cortical folds across individuals allowed between-group comparisons of thickness within ROIs, and at multiple, uniformly sampled loci across the cortical ribbon. RESULTS: Relative to controls, patients showed greater cortical thinning in temporal-prefrontal ROIs than in control ROIs, as revealed by a significant (P<.009) interaction between group and region type. Cortical thickness difference maps revealed significant (at P<.05, corrected) thinning within the orbitofrontal cortices bilaterally; the inferior frontal, inferior temporal, and occipitotemporal cortices on the left; and within the medial temporal and medial frontal cortices on the right. Superior parietal and primary somatosensory and motor cortices were relatively spared, even at subthreshold significance levels. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with chronic schizophrenia showed widespread cortical thinning that particularly affected the prefrontal and temporal cortices. This thinning might reflect underlying neuropathological abnormalities in cortical structure.","2003-09","2019-01-10 01:33:22","2019-01-10 01:33:22","","878-888","","9","60","","Arch. Gen.

Furthermore, there is a growing appreciation of the potential utility of longitudinally acquired structural images and reliable image processing to evaluate disease modifying therapies. Challenges have been related to the variability that is inherent in the available cross-sectional processing tools, to the introduction of bias in longitudinal processing and to potential over-regularization. In this paper we introduce a novel longitudinal image processing framework, based on unbiased, robust, within-subject template creation, for automatic surface reconstruction and segmentation of brain MRI of arbitrarily many time points. We demonstrate that it is essential to treat all input images exactly the same as removing only interpolation asymmetries is not sufficient to remove processing bias. We successfully reduce variability and avoid over-regularization by initializing the processing in each time point with common information from the subject template. The presented results show a significant increase in precision and discrimination power while preserving the ability to detect large anatomical deviations; as such they hold great potential in clinical applications, e.g. allowing for smaller sample sizes or shorter trials to establish disease specific biomarkers or to quantify drug effects.","2012-07-16","2019-01-10 01:33:36","2019-01-10 01:33:36","","1402-1418","","4","61","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 22430496 PMCID: PMC3389460","","/Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/TVF7FPQK/Reuter et al. - 2012 - Within-subject template estimation for unbiased lo.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22430496","","Algorithms; Brain; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although progressive striatal degeneration is known to occur, little is known about how the disease affects the cortex, including which cortical regions are affected, how degeneration proceeds, and the relationship of the cortical degeneration to clinical symptoms. The cortex has been difficult to study in neurodegenerative diseases primarily because of its complex folding patterns and regional variability; however, an understanding of how the cortex is affected by the disease may provide important new insights into it. METHODS: Novel automated surface reconstruction and high-resolution MR images of 11 patients with HD and 13 age-matched subjects were used to obtain cortical thickness measurements. The same analyses were performed on two postmortem brains to validate these methods. RESULTS: Regionally specific heterogeneous thinning of the cortical ribbon was found in subjects with HD. Thinning occurred early, differed among patients in different clinical stages of disease, and appeared to proceed from posterior to anterior cortical regions with disease progression. The sensorimotor region was statistically most affected. Measurements performed on MR images of autopsy brains analyzed similarly were within 0.25 mm of those obtained using traditional neuropathologic methods and were statistically indistinguishable. CONCLUSIONS: The authors propose that the cortex degenerates early in disease and that regionally selective cortical degeneration may explain the heterogeneity of clinical expression in HD. These measures might provide a sensitive prospective surrogate marker for clinical trials of neuroprotective medications.","2002-03-12","2019-01-10 01:35:13","2019-01-10 01:35:13","","695-701","","5","58","","Neurology","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 11889230","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11889230","","Adult; Cerebral Cortex; Female; Humans; Huntington Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For each participant, multiple acquisitions of structural T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were averaged to yield high-resolution, high-contrast data sets. Cortical thickness was estimated as the distance between the gray/white boundary and the outer cortical surface, resulting in a continuous estimate across the cortical mantle. Global thinning was apparent by middle age. Men and women showed a similar degree of global thinning, and did not differ in mean thickness in the younger or older groups. Age-associated differences were widespread but demonstrated a patchwork of regional atrophy and sparing. Examination of subsets of the data from independent samples produced highly similar age-associated patterns of atrophy, suggesting that the specific anatomic patterns within the maps were reliable. Certain results, including prominent atrophy of prefrontal cortex and relative sparing of temporal and parahippocampal cortex, converged with previous findings. Other results were unexpected, such as the finding of prominent atrophy in frontal cortex near primary motor cortex and calcarine cortex near primary visual cortex. These findings demonstrate that cortical thinning occurs by middle age and spans widespread cortical regions that include primary as well as association cortex.","2004-07","2019-01-10 01:35:27","2019-01-10 01:35:27","","721-730","","7","14","","Cereb.

K.; Fischl, B.","A hybrid approach to the skull stripping problem in MRI","NeuroImage","","1053-8119","10.1016/j.neuroimage.2004.03.032","","We present a novel skull-stripping algorithm based on a hybrid approach that combines watershed algorithms and deformable surface models. Our method takes advantage of the robustness of the former as well as the surface information available to the latter. The algorithm first localizes a single white matter voxel in a T1-weighted MRI image, and uses it to create a global minimum in the white matter before applying a watershed algorithm with a preflooding height. The watershed algorithm builds an initial estimate of the brain volume based on the three-dimensional connectivity of the white matter. This first step is robust, and performs well in the presence of intensity nonuniformities and noise, but may erode parts of the cortex that abut bright nonbrain structures such as the eye sockets, or may remove parts of the cerebellum. To correct these inaccuracies, a surface deformation process fits a smooth surface to the masked volume, allowing the incorporation of geometric constraints into the skull-stripping procedure. A statistical atlas, generated from a set of accurately segmented brains, is used to validate and potentially correct the segmentation, and the MRI intensity values are locally re-estimated at the boundary of the brain. Finally, a high-resolution surface deformation is performed that accurately matches the outer boundary of the brain, resulting in a robust and automated procedure. Studies by our group and others outperform other publicly available skull-stripping tools.","2004-07","2019-01-10 01:35:42","2019-01-10 01:35:42","","1060-1075","","3","22","","Neuroimage","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 15219578","","; /Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/2S92L2BR/Ségonne et al. - 2004 - A hybrid approach to the skull stripping problem i.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15219578","","Algorithms; Brain; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Models, Neurological","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose a technique to accurately correct the spherical topology of cortical surfaces. Specifically, we construct a mapping from the original surface onto the sphere to detect topological defects as minimal nonhomeomorphic regions. The topology of each defect is then corrected by opening and sealing the surface along a set of nonseparating loops that are selected in a Bayesian framework. The proposed method is a wholly self-contained topology correction algorithm, which determines geometrically accurate, topologically correct solutions based on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) intensity profile and the expected local curvature. Applied to real data, our method provides topological corrections similar to those made by a trained operator.","2007-04","2019-01-10 01:35:58","2019-01-10 01:35:58","","518-529","","4","26","","IEEE Trans Med Imaging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 17427739","","/Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/QI8LMX54/Ségonne et al. - 2007 - Geometrically accurate topology-correction of cort.pdf; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17427739","","Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Bayes Theorem; Cerebral Cortex; Humans; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The method has the advantage that it can be applied at an early stage in an automated data analysis, before a tissue model is available. Described as nonparametric nonuniform intensity normalization (N3), the method is independent of pulse sequence and insensitive to pathological data that might otherwise violate model assumptions. To eliminate the dependence of the field estimate on anatomy, an iterative approach is employed to estimate both the multiplicative bias field and the distribution of the true tissue intensities. The performance of this method is evaluated using both real and simulated MR data.","1998-02","2019-01-10 01:36:28","2019-01-10 01:36:28","","87-97","","1","17","","IEEE Trans Med Imaging","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 9617910","","; /Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/STQIRHRN/Sled et al. - 1998 - A nonparametric method for automatic correction of.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9617910","","Brain; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Models, Theoretical","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
