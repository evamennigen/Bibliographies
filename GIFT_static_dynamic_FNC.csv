In this Perspective we use the term “chronnectome” to describe metrics that allow a dynamic view of coupling. In the chronnectome, coupling refers to possibly time-varying levels of correlated or mutually informed activity between brain regions whose spatial properties may also be temporally evolving. We primarily focus on multivariate approaches developed in our group and review a number of approaches with an emphasis on matrix decompositions such as principle component analysis and independent component analysis. We also discuss the potential these approaches offer to improve characterization and understanding of brain function. There are a number of methodological directions that need to be developed further, but chronnectome approaches already show great promise for the study of both the healthy and the diseased brain.","2014-10-22","2016-04-22 22:45:57","2017-03-07 00:32:30","2016-04-22 22:45:57","262-274","","2","84","","Neuron","The Chronnectome","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/WGUPKGUP/Calhoun et al. - 2014 - The Chronnectome Time-Varying Connectivity Networ.pdf; /Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/2DWZQN66/S0896627314009131.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Interest in moving beyond this simplifying assumption has emerged only recently. The great hope is that training the right lens on time-varying properties of whole-brain network connectivity will shed additional light on previously concealed brain activation patterns characteristic of serious neurological or psychiatric disorders. We present evidence that multiple explicitly dynamical properties of time-varying whole-brain network connectivity are strongly associated with schizophrenia, a complex mental illness whose symptomatic presentation can vary enormously across subjects. As with so much brain-imaging research, a central challenge for dynamic network connectivity lies in determining transformations of the data that both reduce its dimensionality and expose features that are strongly predictive of important population characteristics. Our paper introduces an elegant, simple method of reducing and organizing data around which a large constellation of mutually informative and intuitive dynamical analyses can be performed. This framework combines a discrete multidimensional data-driven representation of connectivity space with four core dynamism measures computed from large-scale properties of each subject’s trajectory, ie., properties not identifiable with any specific moment in time and therefore reasonable to employ in settings lacking inter-subject time-alignment, such as resting-state functional imaging studies. Our analysis exposes pronounced differences between schizophrenia patients (N sz  = 151) and healthy controls (N hc  = 163). Time-varying whole-brain network connectivity patterns are found to be markedly less dynamically active in schizophrenia patients, an effect that is even more pronounced in patients with high levels of hallucinatory behavior. To the best of our knowledge this is the first demonstration that high-level dynamic properties of whole-brain connectivity, generic enough to be commensurable under many decompositions of time-varying connectivity data, exhibit robust and systematic differences between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls.","2016-03-16","2016-06-07 18:35:40","2017-03-07 00:30:52","2016-06-07 18:35:40","e0149849","","3","11","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","","","","","","PLoS Journals","","","","/Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/DSD4H8KS/Miller et al. - 2016 - Higher Dimensional Meta-State Analysis Reveals Red.pdf; /Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/ZAXEI6FQ/article.html","","","Behavioral and social aspects of health; Demography; Fluid dynamics; functional magnetic resonance imaging; Neural networks; Principal component analysis; schizophrenia; Social psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent studies in humans have questioned this assumption by showing that within-network functional connectivity fluctuates on the order of seconds to minutes. Time-varying profiles of resting-state networks (RSNs) may relate to spontaneously shifting, electrophysiological network states and are thus mechanistically of particular importance. However, because these studies acquired data from awake subjects, the fluctuating connectivity could reflect various forms of conscious brain processing such as passive mind wandering, active monitoring, memory formation, or changes in attention and arousal during image acquisition. Here, we characterize RSN dynamics of anesthetized macaques that control for these accounts, and compare them to awake human subjects. We find that functional connectivity among nodes comprising the “oculomotor (OCM) network” strongly fluctuated over time during awake as well as anaesthetized states. For time dependent analysis with short windows (<60 s), periods of positive functional correlations alternated with prominent anticorrelations that were missed when assessed with longer time windows. Similarly, the analysis identified network nodes that transiently link to the OCM network and did not emerge in average RSN analysis. Furthermore, time-dependent analysis reliably revealed transient states of large-scale synchronization that spanned all seeds. The results illustrate that resting-state functional connectivity is not static and that RSNs can exhibit nonstationary, spontaneous relationships irrespective of conscious, cognitive processing. The findings imply that mechanistically important network information can be missed when using average functional connectivity as the single network measure.

The spatial extent of strongly temporally coherent brain regions co-activated during rest has also been examined using independent component analysis (ICA). However, the weaker temporal relationships among ICA component time courses, which we operationally define as a measure of functional network connectivity (FNC), have not yet been studied. In this study, we propose an approach for evaluating FNC and apply it to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected from persons with schizophrenia and healthy controls. We examined the connectivity and latency among ICA component time courses to test the hypothesis that patients with schizophrenia would show increased functional connectivity and increased lag among resting state networks compared to controls. Resting state fMRI data were collected and the inter-relationships among seven selected resting state networks (identified using group ICA) were evaluated by correlating each subject's ICA time courses with one another. Patients showed higher correlation than controls among most of the dominant resting state networks. Patients also had slightly more variability in functional connectivity than controls. We present a novel approach for quantifying functional connectivity among brain networks identified with spatial ICA. Significant differences between patient and control connectivity in different networks were revealed possibly reflecting deficiencies in cortical processing in patients.","2008-02-15","2016-08-05 20:42:24","2016-08-05 20:42:24","2016-08-05 20:42:24","1666-1681","","4","39","","NeuroImage","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/B5QMRBH5/1-s2.0-S1053811907010282-main.pdf; /Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/T8H3SUD6/S1053811907010282.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One important focus has been on the analysis of brain connectivity using the concept of networks instead of regions. Approximately ten years ago, two important research areas grew out of this concept. First, a network proposed to be “a default mode of brain function” since dubbed the default mode network was proposed by Raichle. Secondly, multisubject or group independent component analysis (ICA) provided a data-driven approach to study properties of brain networks, including the default mode network. In this paper, we provide a focused review of how ICA has contributed to the study of intrinsic networks. We discuss some methodological considerations for group ICA and highlight multiple analytic approaches for studying brain networks. We also show examples of some of the differences observed in the default mode and resting networks in the diseased brain. In summary, we are in exciting times and still just beginning to reap the benefits of the richness of functional brain networks as well as available analytic approaches.","2012","2016-06-09 18:17:11","2016-06-09 18:17:11","","60-73","","","5","","","Multisubject Independent Component Analysis of fMRI","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","/Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/72QVQF2K/abs_all.html; /Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/8F9JVWHQ/Calhoun and Adali - 2012 - Multisubject Independent Component Analysis of fMR.pdf","","","Algorithms; biomedical MRI; brain; brain connectivity; Brain Diseases; Brain function; brain models; complex-valued; Correlation; Default Mode Network; diseased brain; diseases; fMRI; functional brain networks; Functional connectivity; Higher order statistics; Humans; independent component analysis; independent component analysis (ICA); intrinsic networks; Magnetic resonance imaging; medical computing; Models, Neurological; Models, Statistical; multisubject independent component analysis; neural nets; neurodiagnostic discovery; neurophysiology; phase; schizophrenia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These signal changes, both during and after motion, increase observed RSFC correlations in a distance-dependent manner. Motion-related signal changes are not removed by a variety of motion-based regressors, but are effectively reduced by global signal regression. We link several measures of data quality to motion, changes in signal intensity, and changes in RSFC correlations. We demonstrate that improvements in data quality measures during processing may represent cosmetic improvements rather than true correction of the data. We demonstrate a within-subject, censoring-based artifact removal strategy based on volume censoring that reduces group differences due to motion to chance levels.

However, the independence of subject specific independent components (ICs) derived from group ICA has not been explicitly optimized in existing group ICA methods. In order to preserve independence of ICs at the subject level and simultaneously establish correspondence of ICs across subjects, we present a new framework for obtaining subject specific ICs, which we coined group-information guided ICA (GIG-ICA). In this framework, group information captured by standard ICA on the group level is exploited as guidance to compute individual subject specific ICs using a multi-objective optimization strategy. Specifically, we propose a framework with two stages: at first, group ICs (GICs) are obtained using standard group ICA tools, and then the GICs are used as references in a new one-unit ICA with spatial reference (ICA-R) using a multi-objective optimization solver. Comparison experiments with back-reconstruction (GICA1 and GICA3) and dual regression on simulated and real fMRI data have demonstrated that GIG-ICA is able to obtain subject specific ICs with stronger independence and better spatial correspondence across different subjects in addition to higher spatial and temporal accuracy.","2013-04-01","2016-05-18 18:04:34","2016-05-18 18:04:34","2016-05-18 18:04:34","157-197","","","69","","NeuroImage","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/JFEP22H2/1-s2.0-S1053811912011044-main.pdf; /Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/R9U575MZ/Du and Fan - 2013 - Group information guided ICA for fMRI data analysi.pdf; /Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/D9NSXWPH/S1053811912011044.html","","","Enhanced independence; fMRI; Group information; independent component analysis; Multi-objective optimization; Subject specific ICs reconstruction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent functional imaging studies have implicated large-scale thalamo-cortical connectivity as being disrupted in patients. However, observed connectivity differences in schizophrenia have been inconsistent between studies, with reports of hyperconnectivity and hypoconnectivity between the same brain regions. Using resting state eyes-closed functional imaging and independent component analysis on a multi-site data that included 151 schizophrenia patients and 163 age- and gender matched healthy controls, we decomposed the functional brain data into 100 components and identified 47 as functionally relevant intrinsic connectivity networks. We subsequently evaluated group differences in functional network connectivity, both in a static sense, computed as the pairwise Pearson correlations between the full network time courses (5.4 minutes in length), and a dynamic sense, computed using sliding windows (44 s in length) and k-means clustering to characterize five discrete functional connectivity states. Static connectivity analysis revealed that compared to healthy controls, patients show significantly stronger connectivity, i.e., hyperconnectivity, between the thalamus and sensory networks (auditory, motor and visual), as well as reduced connectivity (hypoconnectivity) between sensory networks from all modalities. Dynamic analysis suggests that (1), on average, schizophrenia patients spend much less time than healthy controls in states typified by strong, large-scale connectivity, and (2), that abnormal connectivity patterns are more pronounced during these connectivity states. In particular, states exhibiting cortical–subcortical antagonism (anti-correlations) and strong positive connectivity between sensory networks are those that show the group differences of thalamic hyperconnectivity and sensory hypoconnectivity. Group differences are weak or absent during other connectivity states. Dynamic analysis also revealed hypoconnectivity between the putamen and sensory networks during the same states of thalamic hyperconnectivity; notably, this finding cannot be observed in the static connectivity analysis. Finally, in post-hoc analyses we observed that the relationships between sub-cortical low frequency power and connectivity with sensory networks is altered in patients, suggesting different functional interactions between sub-cortical nuclei and sensorimotor cortex during specific connectivity states. While important differences between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls have been identified, one should interpret the results with caution given the history of medication in patients. Taken together, our results support and expand current knowledge regarding dysconnectivity in schizophrenia, and strongly advocate the use of dynamic analyses to better account for and understand functional connectivity differences.","2014","2016-02-04 23:58:50","2016-02-04 23:58:50","2016-02-04 23:58:50","298-308","","","5","","NeuroImage: Clinical","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/5IHUG3UR/Damaraju et al. - 2014 - Dynamic functional connectivity analysis reveals t.pdf; /Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/C5P3JBGC/S2213158214000953.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we assess several preprocessing pipelines applied in group independent component analysis (gICA) methods to study the rsFNC of the brain. The evaluation method utilizes patient/control classification performance based on linear support vector machines and leave-one-out cross validation. In addition, we explored group tests and correlation with severity measures in the patient population. We also tested the effect of removing high frequencies via filtering. Two real data cohorts were used: one consisting of 48 mTBI and one composed of 21 smokers, both with their corresponding matched controls.

A principal advantage of this approach is its applicability to cognitive paradigms for which detailed models of brain activity are not available. Independent component analysis has been successfully utilized to analyze single-subject fMRI data sets, and an extension of this work would be to provide for group inferences. However, unlike univariate methods (e.g., regression analysis, Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistics), ICA does not naturally generalize to a method suitable for drawing inferences about groups of subjects. We introduce a novel approach for drawing group inferences using ICA of fMRI data, and present its application to a simple visual paradigm that alternately stimulates the left or right visual field. Our group ICA analysis revealed task-related components in left and right visual cortex, a transiently task-related component in bilateral occipital/parietal cortex, and a non-task-related component in bilateral visual association cortex. We address issues involved in the use of ICA as an fMRI analysis method such as: (1) How many components should be calculated? (2) How are these components to be combined across subjects? (3) How should the final results be thresholded and/or presented? We show that the methodology we present provides answers to these questions and lay out a process for making group inferences from fMRI data using independent component analysis. Hum.

Several multi-subject ICA approaches estimating subject-specific time courses (TCs) and spatial maps (SMs) have been developed, however, there has not yet been a full comparison of the implications of their use. Here, we provide extensive comparisons of four multi-subject ICA approaches in combination with data reduction methods for simulated and fMRI task data. For multi-subject ICA, the data first undergo reduction at the subject and group levels using principal component analysis (PCA). Comparisons of subject-specific, spatial concatenation, and group data mean subject-level reduction strategies using PCA and probabilistic PCA (PPCA) show that computationally intensive PPCA is equivalent to PCA, and that subject-specific and group data mean subject-level PCA are preferred because of well-estimated TCs and SMs. Second, aggregate independent components are estimated using either noise-free ICA or probabilistic ICA (PICA). Third, subject-specific SMs and TCs are estimated using back-reconstruction. We compare several direct group ICA (GICA) back-reconstruction approaches (GICA1-GICA3) and an indirect back-reconstruction approach, spatio-temporal regression (STR, or dual regression). Results show the earlier group ICA (GICA1) approximates STR, however STR has contradictory assumptions and may show mixed-component artifacts in estimated SMs. Our evidence-based recommendation is to use GICA3, introduced here, with subject-specific PCA and noise-free ICA, providing the most robust and accurate estimated SMs and TCs in addition to offering an intuitive interpretation.

The synchrony or lack thereof between different brain regions is thought to correspond to observed functional connectivity dynamics in resting state brain imaging data. In a large sample of healthy human adult subjects and utilizing a sliding windowed correlation method on functional imaging data, earlier we demonstrated the presence of seven distinct functional connectivity states/patterns between different brain networks that reliably occur across time and subjects. Whether these connectivity states correspond to meaningful electrophysiological signatures was not clear. In this study, using a dataset with concurrent EEG and resting state functional imaging data acquired during eyes open and eyes closed states, we demonstrate the replicability of previous findings in an independent sample, and identify EEG spectral signatures associated with these functional network connectivity changes. Eyes open and eyes closed conditions show common and different connectivity patterns that are associated with distinct EEG spectral signatures. Certain connectivity states are more prevalent in the eyes open case and some occur only in eyes closed state. Both conditions exhibit a state of increased thalamocortical anticorrelation associated with reduced EEG spectral alpha power and increased delta and theta power possibly reflecting drowsiness. This state occurs more frequently in the eyes closed state. In summary, we find a link between dynamic connectivity in fMRI data and concurrently collected EEG data, including a large effect of vigilance on functional connectivity. As demonstrated with EEG and fMRI, the stationarity of connectivity cannot be assumed, even for relatively short periods.","2017-02-22","2017-10-20 21:41:48","2017-10-20 21:41:48","2017-10-20 21:41:48","1-16","","","","","Brain Topogr","","","","","","","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","","","/Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/CQN6J35L/Allen et al. - 2017 - EEG Signatures of Dynamic Functional Network Conne.pdf; /Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/VGID7F9L/s10548-017-0546-2.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the number of studies that do true multimodal fusion (i.e., capitalizing on joint information among modalities) is still remarkably small given the known benefits. In part, this is because multimodal studies require broader expertise in collecting, analyzing, and interpreting the results than do unimodal studies. In this article, we start by introducing the basic reasons why multimodal data fusion is important and what it can do and, importantly, how it can help us avoid wrong conclusions and help compensate for imperfect brain imaging studies. We also discuss the challenges that need to be confronted for such approaches to be more widely applied by the community. We then provide a review of the diverse studies that have used multimodal data fusion (primarily focused on psychosis) as well as provide an introduction to some of the existing analytic approaches. Finally, we discuss some up-and-coming approaches to multimodal fusion including deep learning and multimodal classification that show considerable promise. Our conclusion is that multimodal data fusion is rapidly growing, but it is still underutilized. The complexity of the human brain coupled with the incomplete measurement provided by existing imaging technology makes multimodal fusion essential to mitigate misdirection and hopefully provide a key to finding the missing link(s) in complex mental illness.","2016-05-01","2018-01-12 20:37:27","2018-01-12 20:37:27","2018-01-12 20:37:27","230-244","","3","1","","Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging","Multimodal Fusion of Brain Imaging Data","Brain Connectivity in Psychopathology","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/JNBBN9R8/Calhoun and Sui - 2016 - Multimodal Fusion of Brain Imaging Data A Key to .pdf; /Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/AJ6KUE8B/S2451902216000598.html","","","Brain function; Connectivity; Data fusion; Independent component analysis; Psychosis; Schizophrenia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Group ICA computes group-level components from all data and subsequently estimates individual-level components to recapture intersubject variability. However, the best approach to handle artifacts, which may vary widely among subjects, is not yet clear. In this work, we study and compare two ICA approaches for artifacts removal. One approach, recommended in recent work by the Human Connectome Project, first performs ICA on individual subject data to remove artifacts, and then applies a group ICA on the cleaned data from all subjects. We refer to this approach as Individual ICA based artifacts Removal Plus Group ICA (IRPG). A second proposed approach, called Group Information Guided ICA (GIG-ICA), performs ICA on group data, then removes the group-level artifact components, and finally performs subject-specific ICAs using the group-level non-artifact components as spatial references. We used simulations to evaluate the two approaches with respect to the effects of data quality, data quantity, variable number of sources among subjects, and spatially unique artifacts. Resting-state test–retest datasets were also employed to investigate the reliability of functional networks. Results from simulations demonstrate GIG-ICA has greater performance compared with IRPG, even in the case when single-subject artifacts removal is perfect and when individual subjects have spatially unique artifacts. Experiments using test–retest data suggest that GIG-ICA provides more reliable functional networks. Based on high estimation accuracy, ease of implementation, and high reliability of functional networks, we find GIG-ICA to be a promising approach.

In contrast to the widely used general linear model (GLM) that requires the user to parameterize the data (e.g. the brain’s response to stimuli), ICA, by relying upon a general assumption of independence, allows the user to be agnostic regarding the exact form of the response. In addition, ICA is intrinsically a multivariate approach, and hence each component provides a grouping of brain activity into regions that share the same response pattern thus providing a natural measure of functional connectivity. There are a wide variety of ICA approaches that have been proposed, in this paper we focus upon two distinct methods. The first part of this paper reviews the use of ICA for making group inferences from fMRI data. We provide an overview of current approaches for utilizing ICA to make group inferences with a focus upon the group ICA approach implemented in the GIFT software. In the next part of this paper, we provide an overview of the use of ICA to combine or fuse multimodal data. ICA has proven particularly useful for data fusion of multiple tasks or data modalities such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data or event-related potentials.

A great effort has been dedicated in the last two decades to investigate functional connectivity (FC), i.e. the functional interplay between different regions of the brain, which was for a long time assumed to have stationary nature. Only recently was the dynamic behaviour of FC revealed, showing that on top of correlational patterns of spontaneous fMRI signal fluctuations, connectivity between different brain regions exhibits meaningful variations within a typical resting-state fMRI experiment. As a consequence, a considerable amount of work has been directed to assessing and characterising dynamic FC (dFC), and several different approaches were explored to identify relevant FC fluctuations. At the same time, several questions were raised about the nature of dFC, which would be of interest only if brought back to a neural origin. In support of this, correlations with electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, demographic and behavioural data were established, and various clinical applications were explored, where the potential of dFC could be preliminarily demonstrated. In this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive description of the dFC approaches proposed so far, and point at the directions that we see as most promising for the future developments of the field.

This shift in focus has led to a flurry of interest in developing hypothesis testing frameworks and null models applicable to the dynamical setting. Thus far however, efforts in this direction have been weakened by a number of crucial shortcomings, several of which are outlined and discussed in this short paper. The discussion below is important because the weaknesses exhibited by many of the recently proposed models are not merely quantitative or parametric. Rather they are fundamental, falling into categories that ultimately neutralize the ability of the resulting models to play a scientifically clarifying role, while simultaneously injecting distracting new vectors of murkiness and confusion into a young but promising research enterprise these efforts are surely intended to support. One key point emphasized in this paper is that since functionally relevant temporal variations in brain activation are undeniably continual in living human rs-fMRI subjects (e.g., the period of time during which all neural activity throughout a human brain carries no functional relevance whatsoever is something whose existence, even during stroke or seizure, seems highly improbable), “absence of brain dynamics” as a null hypothesis for fMRI imaging studies is neither scientifically interesting nor well-defined. As we learn more about the phenomenon of functionally relevant brain dynamics (FRBD) and its imaging correlates, scientifically meaningful null hypotheses and well-tuned null models will naturally emerge. In the course of our discussion, we revisit the important concept of stationarity, what it is, how to assess it from multiple realizations of a process and finally attempt to parse through the benefits and limitations of applying this property in models of rs-fMRI data. We hope that the discussions herein are useful, and promote thoughtful consideration of these important issues.","2017-06-22","2018-09-11 17:59:54","2018-09-11 17:59:54","2018-09-11 17:59:54","153411","","","","","","Resting-State fMRI Dynamics and Null Models","","","","","","","en","© 2017, Posted by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

Accordingly, brain functional connectivity is not static in time, but fluctuates dynamically following the synchronization and desynchronization of neural populations. This dynamic functional connectivity has recently been demonstrated in spontaneous fluctuations of the Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent (BOLD) signal, measured with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). We analyzed temporal fluctuations in BOLD connectivity and their electrophysiological correlates, by means of long (approx. 50 min) joint electroencephalographic (EEG) and fMRI recordings obtained from two populations: 15 awake subjects and 13 subjects undergoing vigilance transitions. We identified positive and negative correlations between EEG spectral power (extracted from electrodes covering different scalp regions) and fMRI BOLD connectivity in a network of 90 cortical and subcortical regions (with millimeter spatial resolution). In particular, increased alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) power were related to decreased functional connectivity, whereas gamma (30-60 Hz) power correlated positively with BOLD connectivity between specific brain regions. These patterns were altered for subjects undergoing vigilance changes, with slower oscillations being correlated with functional connectivity increases. Dynamic BOLD functional connectivity was reflected in the fluctuations of graph theoretical indices of network structure, with changes in frontal and central alpha power correlating with average path length. Our results strongly suggest that fluctuations of BOLD functional connectivity have a neurophysiological origin. Positive correlations with gamma can be interpreted as facilitating increased BOLD connectivity needed to integrate brain regions for cognitive performance. Negative correlations with alpha suggest a temporary functional weakening of local and long-range connectivity, associated with an idling state.","2012","2018-10-19 22:13:48","2018-10-19 22:13:48","2018-10-19 22:13:48","","","","6","","Front.

Researchers have begun utilizing simultaneous imaging and electrophysiological recording to elucidate the neural basis of the networks and their variability in animals and in humans. In this article, we review ﬁndings that link changes in electrically recorded brain states to changes in the networks obtained with rsMRI and discuss some of the challenges inherent in interpretation of these studies. The literature suggests that multiple brain processes may contribute to the dynamics observed, and we speculate that it may be possible to separate particular aspects of the rsMRI signal to enhance sensitivity to certain types of neural activity, providing new tools for basic neuroscience and clinical research.","2014-12","2018-10-19 22:24:09","2018-10-19 22:24:09","2018-10-19 22:24:09","769-779","","10","4","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Crossref","","","","/Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/BCG5H78Y/Keilholz - 2014 - The Neural Basis of Time-Varying Resting-State Fun.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although several studies have reported the presence of dynamic functional connectivity (dFC), statistical assessment of the results is not always carried out in a sound way and, in some studies, is even omitted. In this study, we explain why appropriate statistical tests are needed to detect dFC, we describe how they can be carried out and how to assess the performance of dFC measures, and we illustrate the methodology using spontaneous blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI recordings of macaque monkeys under general anesthesia and in human subjects under resting-state conditions. We mainly focus on sliding-window correlations since these are most widely used in assessing dFC, but also consider a recently proposed non-linear measure. The simulations and methodology, however, are general and can be applied to any measure. The results are twofold. First, through simulations, we show that in typical resting-state sessions of 10min, it is almost impossible to detect dFC using sliding-window correlations. This prediction is validated by both the macaque and the human data: in none of the individual recording sessions was evidence for dFC found. Second, detection power can be considerably increased by session- or subject-averaging of the measures. In doing so, we found that most of the functional connections are in fact dynamic. With this study, we hope to raise awareness of the statistical pitfalls in the assessment of dFC and how they can be avoided by using appropriate statistical methods.","2016-02-15","2019-01-10 16:43:39","2019-01-10 16:43:39","","242-256","","","127","","NeuroImage","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/6N3396GY/1-s2.0-S1053811915010782-main.pdf; /Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/WDCG4SEJ/1-s2.0-S1053811915010782-main.pdf; /Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/Z37HQ3IY/1-s2.0-S1053811915010782-main.pdf; /Users/Eva/Zotero/storage/7YGSJ4LX/S1053811915010782.html","","","Dynamic functional connectivity; Functional MRI; Resting state; Surrogate data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
